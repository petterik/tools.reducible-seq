# tools.reducible-seq

Experimenting with optimizing the sequence functions with a transducer to implement IReduceInit. 

Near 5x performance speed up in a very good case.

There are some downsides though. One being a breaking change, where sequences could be calculated twice if one is not careful. There's a warning when this happens though.

## Usage

```sh
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {petterik/tools.reducible-seq {:git/url "https://github.com/petterik/tools.reducible-seq" :sha "5a7496212433cbafc4058a62b79ac35292430264"}}}'
```

```clj
(require '[petterik.tools.reducible-seq])
(in-ns 'petterik.tools.reducible-seq)

;; Using clojure.core's map, mapcat, filter and keep
(let [map clojure.core/map
      filter clojure.core/filter
      mapcat clojure.core/mapcat]
  (time (->> (range (long 1e6))
          (map str)
          (mapcat seq)
          (map int)
          (filter even?)
          (keep #(when (< 2 %) %))
          (map inc)
          (map inc)
          (map inc)
          (map inc)
          (map inc)
          (reduce + 0))))
;; Elapsed time: 3086.734262 msecs
